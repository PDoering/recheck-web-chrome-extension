This is a convenient demo to check web pages for differences using recheck-web. When clicking the button, it will send all of the website data to retest (https://retest.de/), where it will be either stored as Golden Master for later comparison or compared to an existing Golden Master and the differences be highlighted.

The result will be generated in the form of a retest report, for which either the review GUI (https://retest.de/review/) or the open source recheck.cli (https://github.com/retest/recheck.cli) are needed. Using the review GUI, you can use filters to ignore style differences, positioning differences or create your own filter. 

You need to create a free retest account to use this extension.

recheck-web is an open source product at https://github.com/retest/recheck-web.
