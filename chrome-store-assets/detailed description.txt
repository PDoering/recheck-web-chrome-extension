This is a convenient demo to check web pages for differences using recheck-web. When clicking the button, it will send all of the website data to retest (https://retest.de/), where it will be either stored as Golden Master for later comparison or compared to an existing Golden Master and the differences be highlighted. 

Using either the review GUI or the open source recheck.cli, you can filters the differences and quickly find relevant changes. This gives you unprecedented power: ignore font changes but not the text. Or ignore content but not CSS. Define your own filters with a simple git-like syntax.

You need to create a free retest account to use this extension. It needs permission to "Read and change your data on all retest.org sites" to send login data to retest.

recheck-web is an open source product at https://github.com/retest/recheck-web.
