This is a convenient demo to check web pages using recheck-web (https://github.com/retest/recheck-web). When clicking the button, it will send all of the website data to retest (https://retest.de/), where it will be either stored as Golden Master or compared to an existing Golden Master and the differences are calculated.

The result will be generated in the form of a retest report (at http://garkbit.prod.cloud.retest.org/dashboard), for which the review GUI (https://retest.de/review/) or the open source recheck.cli (https://github.com/retest/recheck.cli) are needed. You need to either create a retest account (https://sso.prod.cloud.retest.org/auth/realms/customer/account/) or setup the service locally and have the data sent to that service.
