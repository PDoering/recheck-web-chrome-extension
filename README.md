# recheck-web-chrome-extension

A Chrome extension that uses [recheck-web](https://github.com/retest/recheck-web) to let you manually create 'checkpoints' of web sites.
Using recheck-web together with the [recheck.cli](https://github.com/retest/recheck.cli) or the [review GUI](https://retest.de/review/), you can now easily find differences in websites. 
Using filters, you can easily differentiate between style, positioning or content differencesâ€”-you can even define your own category!
